# UFC Moves Detector using OpenCV

This project uses OpenCV to detect and analyze moves in UFC (Ultimate Fighting Championship) videos. It aims to automatically identify and track various movements, such as punches, kicks, takedowns, and submissions, within UFC fight footage.

## Overview

This project analyzes UFC fight videos to identify and track different moves performed by the fighters.  It utilizes computer vision techniques with OpenCV to process the video frames and detect specific actions.  The goal is to provide a tool for automatically annotating and analyzing fight footage, which could be useful for training analysis, performance evaluation, or even fan engagement.

## Features

* **Move Detection:** Detects various UFC moves (e.g., punches, kicks, takedowns, submissions). *(List the specific moves detected.)*
* **Motion Tracking:** Tracks the movement of fighters and their limbs. *(Specify the tracking method used.)*
* **Video Processing:** Processes video files to extract frames and analyze movement.
* **[Other Features]:** List any other relevant features (e.g., output annotations, performance metrics).

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** The primary programming language.
* **OpenCV (cv2):** For video processing, object tracking, and image manipulation.
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
NumPy: For numerical operations.
Bash

pip install numpy
[Other Libraries]: List any other Python libraries used (e.g., scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras for any machine learning models).
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.x: A compatible Python version.
Required Libraries: Install the necessary Python libraries (see above).
UFC Video File: You'll need a UFC fight video file.
Installation
Clone the Repository:

Bash

git clone [https://github.com/Parasuram19/UFC_moves_detector_using_opencv.git](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://www.google.com/search%3Fq%3Dhttps://www.google.com/search%253Fq%253Dhttps://www.google.com/search%25253Fq%25253Dhttps://www.google.com/search%2525253Fq%2525253Dhttps://www.google.com/search%252525253Fq%252525253Dhttps://github.com/Parasuram19/UFC_moves_detector_using_opencv.git)
Navigate to the Directory:

Bash

cd UFC_moves_detector_using_opencv
Install Dependencies:

Bash

pip install -r requirements.txt  # If you have a requirements.txt file
# OR install individually as shown above
Running the Code
Place Video File: Put your UFC video file in the same directory as the Python script or specify the path to the video file in the script.

Run the Script:

Bash

python ufc_moves_detector.py  # Replace ufc_moves_detector.py with the name of your script
(Explain any command-line arguments or configuration options.  For example, if you have parameters to set the region of interest (ROI) or the type of moves to detect.)

Output: The script will process the video and generate a new video file with the detected moves highlighted or annotated. (Specify the output file name and location.  Explain how the moves are visually represented.)

Move Detection Methods
(Explain the methods used to detect the different UFC moves.  Be specific.  For example:)

Punch Detection: Explain how punches are detected (e.g., based on hand movement, speed, trajectory). Are you using any machine learning models here?
Kick Detection: Explain how kicks are detected.
Takedown Detection: Explain how takedowns are detected.
Submission Detection: Explain how submissions are detected.
If you're using any machine learning models for move detection, provide details about the model architecture, training data, and evaluation metrics.

Tracking Method
(Explain the object tracking method used.  For example:)

Background Subtraction: Describe which background subtraction method is used (e.g., MOG2, KNNBackgroundSubtractor).
Optical Flow: Explain if optical flow is used and which algorithm.
Other Methods: Describe any other tracking methods used.
